# Apple Swift CO-OP Program

## Summary 
Work from Apple's ICT Co-op Program. Includes all work from learning Swift and iOS mobile development from Apple's Developer curriculum books. Includes lessons, exercises, and unit projects completed. Also includes self-developed app (Pocket Plan) to apply skilled learned in Swift into a meaningful project built for the App Store.

## Role in Program 
My role was as a remote iOS App developer, working with mentor developers to learn Swift, and working with Apple Education to produce structure and curriculum for the program. Everyday my schedule entailed learning new Swift programming concepts, continous verison control with Git, collaborating and discussing my code with seasonsed iOS developers.

## Skills Learned 
* SwiftUI for dynamic user interface building
* Learned and applied Apple's Human User Interface principles to create complaint apps to standards 
* Thoroughly studied MVC Design patterns for view controller classes and app structure 
* Connecting attributes to event management inputs, such as buttons, lables or image views (outlets/actions)
* Auto-layout and constraint features to ensure responsive design for different devices 
* View controller connections using segues and modals with transitions 
* Cococa sub-classes for other view controllers required
* Using Swift's classes/structs to build properties + methods and additional features to code 

## Apps Built
1) Word Guessing Game - Learning Multi-Player, Data management, onditionals
2) Quiz Game - Learning user-inputs, processing variable data to determine output screen 
3) Hotel Management App - Storing Data, System Memory persistence through Codable 
4) Nasa API Plantery App - HTTPS and URL Sessions, decoding JSON, Concurrency
5) Augmented Reality - Using nodes and transformation properties and Swift's ARkit to create 3D graphics to position in real-word using camera and vertical/horizontal plane detection
6) Pocket Plan (Personal App for App Store) - After completing 800 pages of learning material, designed and built a task planner app that tracks daily tasks, calendar events and note-taking, culminating project to demonstrate proficency in Swift
